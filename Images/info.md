Images Folder
=========================
- "AUC-Epoch_All.png" is a graph of AUC Score vs Epoch for the supervised CNN model and two unsupervised CNN models
- "filters_unsup.png" is a visualization of the convolutional filters learned by the unsupervised CNN models in the 0th layer (layer that receives raw input images)
- "Model-1" is a folder containing ROC curve and AUC Score vs Epoch graphs from training results for Model 1, as well as an image of the CNN model architecture
- "Model-2" is a folder containing ROC curve and AUC Score vs Epoch graphs from training results for Model 2
